If you use Vim, you would be amazed that you can still find something super useful after a long time. Marker navigation is the same case for me.  I've used Vim for over a year, daily, and have a configuration of 800 lines,  yet hadn't met that trick. But today is the day. 

Try marking a position with a/b/c... for quick navigation and `''`for jumping back/forward; it's super easy and productive.

normal mode shortcut | usage
-|-
`m{mark name}` | e.g. `ma` for marking position a
`'{mark name]`| e.g. `ma` for jumping to position a

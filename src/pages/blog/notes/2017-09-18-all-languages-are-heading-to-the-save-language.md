Javascript adopted `Class`, `Map`, `Constructors` from other object-oriented language, or `Promise` from `C#,' etc. Also, it is heading for syntax from other languages in the future. And it is not uncommon in the programming world; it happens to Java, Python, and lots of other languages. It's easier for developers jumping from one to another, but when you find languages look similar, you are not going to be excited anymore. It's not fun to have languages looking similar.

We need different languages having different features and solving the problem in a different way. Otherwise, why bother having so many similar languages, we can just use one. Like learning OOP or FP, or Procedural Programming. They can make things done not in the same way, and that's where the fun comes from. If you like things done one thing at a time in a simple way, like a routine, use Procedural Programming style, or FP. If you want things to be done in a more constructed way, use OOP. They both have different merits and that's why they both exist, and why trying new things out are fun.

> In[computer science](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Computer_science),**imperative programming**is a [programming paradigm](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Programming_paradigm) that uses [statements](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Statement_(computer_science)) that change a program's[state](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/State_(computer_science)). In much the same way that the [imperative mood](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Imperative_mood) in [natural languages](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Natural_language) expresses commands, an imperative program consists of[commands](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Command_(computing)) for the [computer](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Computer) to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describinghowa program operates.

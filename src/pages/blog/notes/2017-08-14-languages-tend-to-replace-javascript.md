Just checked out the scala official doc, apparently they put the to-javascript compiler on the front page, which gives a pretty clean peek of the things Scala can possibly make javascript better. And as always, like the reset of compiling-to-js-from-a-better-languages world, Scala has some better solutions for typed system, collections, class syntaxs, etc. Also, the [Scala.js doc](https://www.scala-js.org/) looks pretty neat!

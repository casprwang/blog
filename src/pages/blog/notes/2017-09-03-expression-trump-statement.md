In programming, a statement is about changing states, while expression is all about the results. Which means. Expressions usually have fewer side effects on the states, especially outer states, and should be heavily used for functional programming. 

Taking the following Scala(everything is an expression in Scala) codes as an example:


```scala
def abs(n: Int): Int = 


```

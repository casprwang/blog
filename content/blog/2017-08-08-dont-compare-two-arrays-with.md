So, if you want to check if two arrays are equal, you might want

```js
;([] ===
  [][
    // or

    (1, 2, 3)
  ]) ===
  [1, 2, 3]
```

Well, by that you would probably assume two trues come back, but actually, you are going to get false and false.

so, better use join() so you can compare strings.

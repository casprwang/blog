I added this plugin called [Tab position options](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-position-options/fjccjnfkdkdmjohojoggodkigkjkkjhl?hl=en) today to help me opening a new tab right next the current one. Unlike the default behavior, this way helps me focusing on the current secion of tabs when too many have been opened on the side.

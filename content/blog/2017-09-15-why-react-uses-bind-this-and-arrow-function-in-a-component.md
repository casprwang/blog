## Arrow

> The ES2015 specification introduces the[arrow function syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions)for writing function expressions. As well as being terser than regular function expressions, they can also have implicit return and most importantly, they always use the value of `this` from the enclosing scope.

## Bind this

> React allows you to define arbitrary methods on your component classes and these methods are automatically bound with the correct context for `this` when you create your components with `React.createClass`. This allows you move your callback code out onto your component.

If you use Vim, you would be amazed by find something super useful even using after a long time. Marker navigation is the same case for me. I've used Vim for over a year, daily, and have a configuration of 800 lines, yet hadn't met that trick. But today is the day.

Try marking a position with a/b/c... for quick navigation and `''`for jumping back/forward; it's super easy and productive.

| normal mode shortcut | usage                               |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `m{mark name}`       | e.g. `ma` for marking position a    |
| `'{mark name]`       | e.g. `ma` for jumping to position a |

Today I am self-encouraged to write more, which primarily influenced by the following reason:

1. My [blog site](songwang.io) has just been finished and published, and since it’s a more-than-a-half-year project, with online [CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) services(so I can blog anywhere). It will be such a shame if I don’t fulfill some of its purposes.
2. I started reusing [Grammarly](www.grammarly.com/‎) for grammar checking service recently.
3. I practiced over months for typing, which would be another shame not used by writing.
4. Those three reasons' grammar has already annoyed me enough.

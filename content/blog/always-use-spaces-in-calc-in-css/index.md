The `+` and `-` operators must always be surrounded by whitespace. The operand of `calc(50% -8px)` for instance will be parsed as a percentage followed by a negative length, an invalid expression, while the operand of `calc(50% - 8px)` is a percentage followed by a minus sign and a length. Even further, `calc(8px + -50%)` is treated as a length followed by a plus sign and a negative percentage.

title: For in is not good for array looping with index

I am having a different result from two simple looping approach.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < left.length; i++) {
	bfs([...temp, left[i]], [...left.slice(0, i), ...left.slice(i + 1)]);
}
```

and

```js
for (let i in left) {
	bfs([...temp, left[i]], [...left.slice(0, i), ...left.slice(i + 1)]);
}
```

The problem came from a bad use of for in for array looping with the care of indexing

> Note:`for...in`should not be used to iterate over an[`Array`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)where the index order is important. --- MDN

Here what I learned.

### Be present and visible

It should be the first priority to stay present. No matter how big or small the incident, an immediate reaction is the best response. If you need to take a break, get a cover-up.

### Follow the procedures

Don't be smart when you have the manual in front of you, even if it makes little sense.

### Leave footprints

Most of the incidences are likely to have happened before and will happen after. If you found the previous notes or post mortem left earlier, you'll have a much easier time. If not, this is a good time to start documenting. Plenty of people will be blessed.

### Ask around

You can get the answers around you, and it's ok to ask, especially in the first couple of rounds.

### Kill, restart or reboot

Use them as a last resort.

title: Don't refer a child from another child when declaring an obj

Apparently, in declaring an obj, a child cannot be assign or refer to another child within the same obj which is being declared.

```js
let obj = {
  a: 1,
  b: 3,
}

console.log(obj.c)
// => undefined
```

Instead, declare function to re-access the obj like this

```js
let obj2 = {
  a: 'it',
  b() {
    return this.a + ' works'
  },
}

console.log(obj2.b())
// => it works
```

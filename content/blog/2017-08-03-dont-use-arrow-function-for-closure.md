title: Don't use arrow function for closure

â€‹I love both closure and arrow function; I take one for simplified class and one for simplified function syntax. After a try, I found that they don't like each other.

I was imagining this

```js
const makeEmployee = name =>
  function getName() {
    return name
  }
```

or

```js
const makeEmployee = name => () => name
```

would work like

```
const makeEmployee = name => {
  return {
    getName() {
      return name
    }
  }
}
```

apparently, arrow functions are made for one liner things, not without a function name or returning a normal function.

I spend a few hours uploaded my first NPM modules, [chinese-year](https://github.com/wangsongiam/chinese-year), which returns the Chinese zodiac animals' list, or, the name of a particular year. It's a super simple package, but it's the first NPM module I published. More on that, it has test cases I wrote with `jest`, and `Travis.ci` implementation.

## Install

```
npm install --save chinese-year
```

## Usage

```js
const chineseYear = require("chinese-year");
chineseYear.years;
//=> ['Rat', 'Ox', ...]

chineseYear.getAnimal(2000);
//=> 'Dragon'
```

## API

.getAnimal(year: number):string
.year:array
get zodiac animal name of a year number

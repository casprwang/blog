I'm Casper. Nice to meet you!

I'm a software engineer. I work at [TuSimple](https://www.tusimple.com/), previously [Citadel](https://www.citadel.com/).

I develop tools and applications, from small pieces to large systems. I believe in web and open platforms.

I love sharing my thoughts and ideas. You can find my footprints on [Github](https://github.com/casprwang), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/casprwang), and some writings here. 

I'm interested in the people behind codes; feel free to say hi at [casprwang@gmail.com](mailto:casprwang@gmail.com).

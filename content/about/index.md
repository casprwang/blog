I'm Casper. Nice to meet you!

I'm a software engineer making useful things. I work at [TuSimple](https://www.tusimple.com/), previously [Citadel](https://www.citadel.com/).

I develop tools and applications, from small pieces to large distributed systems. I believe in web and open platforms.

You can find my footprints on [Github](https://github.com/casprwang), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/casprwang) and some writings here. Or, feel free to reach out to casprwang@gmail.com.

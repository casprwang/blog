![Casper Wang](FullSizeRender 4.jpg "From GraphQL Summit. Hello!")

I'm Casper. Nice to meet you!

I'm a software engineer, primarily focusing on full-stack engineering. I enjoy building user-friendly products. I currently work for [Robinhood](https://robinhood.com/), and previously [Citadel](https://www.citadel.com/).

I develop tools and applications, from small pieces to large systems.

Sometimes I share thoughts and ideas. You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/casprwang), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/casprwang), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/casprwang/), and some writings here.

I'm also interested in the people behind codes; feel free to say hi at [casprwang@gmail.com](mailto:casprwang@gmail.com).

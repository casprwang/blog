Hello, my name is Song Wang.

I am a software engineer at [Citadel](https://www.citadel.com/), previously [TuSimple](http://www.tusimple.com/) and [Sony](https://www.sony.com/). I live in ~~Beijing~~, ~~Chengdu~~, ~~Tokyo~~,  ~~San Diego~~, New York.

I am interested in coding and design, from infrastructure to application.

I love open source, and I contribute from [my Github](https://github.com/wangsongiam/) as a hobby.

I am a [top 5% fastest](https://www.keyhero.com/profile/user67157/) typist in the world.

## About songwang.io

This is my blog site, with a focus on simplicity and performance. It was built with Jekyll and got migrated to Gatsby. It's also coded in the functional paradigm and fully [open sourced](https://github.com/wangsongiam/songwang.io).

While the site is about expressing myself through words, the UI and codes are also carrying my reflections.
